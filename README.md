## Project Description

This project implements a system for planning and analyzing network infrastructure using various graph and computational geometry algorithms. It aims to solve four specific problems often encountered in network design and geographical analysis:

1. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: Utilizes Kruskal's Algorithm for efficient fiber network planning.
2. **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: Employs the Nearest Neighbor heuristic for optimizing delivery routes.
3. **Maximum Flow Analysis**: Applies the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm to analyze network capacity.
4. **Voronoi Diagram Generation**: Creates Voronoi partitions for geographical area segmentation.

## Functionalities

### 1. Minimum Spanning Tree (Fiber Network Planning)
- **Description**: Finds the optimal way to connect nodes (neighborhoods) in a network with minimum cost.
- **Algorithm**: Kruskal's Algorithm.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(E \log E)\), where \(E\) is the number of edges.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(V + E)\), where \(V\) is the number of vertices.

### 2. Traveling Salesman Problem (Route Optimization)
- **Description**: Optimizes routes for delivery personnel across all neighborhoods.
- **Algorithm**: Nearest Neighbor heuristic.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(V^2)\), where \(V\) is the number of vertices.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(V)\).
- **Note**: This is a heuristic approach and does not guarantee the optimal solution.

### 3. Maximum Flow Analysis (Network Capacity)
- **Description**: Determines the maximum possible data flow between nodes in the network.
- **Algorithm**: Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm with BFS.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(VE^2)\), where \(V\) is the number of vertices and \(E\) is the number of edges.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(V^2)\).

### 4. Voronoi Diagram Generation (Geographical Partitioning)
- **Description**: Divides a geographical area into distinct regions around given points, useful for service area delineation.
- **Algorithm**: Delaunay Triangulation (dual of Voronoi diagram).
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of points.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\).

## Test Cases

- **test1.txt**: Validates basic functionality with small, symmetrical matrices.
- **test2.txt**: Assesses scalability of the algorithms on larger datasets.
- **test3.txt**: Tests numerical stability with a variety of input magnitudes.

## Main Functions and Their Complexities

### Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)
- **Complexity**: \(O(E \log E)\)
- **Description**: Builds the MST by connecting nodes with the least total weight.

### Nearest Neighbor Heuristic (Traveling Salesman Problem)
- **Complexity**: \(O(V^2)\)
- **Description**: Constructs a TSP route by selecting the nearest unvisited neighbor, starting from a chosen node.

### Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm (Maximum Flow)
- **Complexity**: \(O(VE^2)\)
- **Description**: Finds the maximum flow in a flow network by augmenting paths until no more are available.

### Voronoi Diagram (Delaunay Triangulation)
- **Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Description**: Partitions a 2D plane into regions based on proximity to a set of input points.

## Running the Program

1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   make
Run the executable:
./main < input.txt
input.txt should contain data in the expected format for each section:
MST/TSP adjacency matrix.
Max flow capacity matrix.
Coordinates for Voronoi diagram.
